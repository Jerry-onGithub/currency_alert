# currency_alert
Currency alert, notification sender, cryptocurrency price followup

This is just a simple personal project that I did to notify me about the cryptocurrency bitcoin price, to send a notification if it decreases below a certain price. It's totally
adjustable and you can use it for your own purpopse and modify it according to your needs, change or add type of cryptocurrency, modify the time interval like every how many 
minutes or hours you need it to check, and set the price you're targeting.

I used API from https://data.messari.io/.
